EN：Aerial perspective, ultra-wide-angle lens, Vietnamese terraced rice field photography. At sunset, the warm sunlight shines on the golden rice fields, forming a strong contrast between light and dark, showing the layering and curvaceous beauty of the rice fields. The terraces are stacked layer by layer, winding into the distance, blending into the background of undulating mountains. A few simple houses are dotted in the picture, adding a pastoral atmosphere. The overall style is realistic, with moderate color saturation and warm tones, and has a strong natural scenery feature. The composition adopts the golden ratio, which has a strong visual impact. The style is similar to the photography works of National Geographic magazine. High resolution and clear details. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 6.1
