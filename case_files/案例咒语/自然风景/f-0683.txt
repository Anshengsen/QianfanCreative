EN：Dark forest, shot from a low angle, with thick tree roots intertwined and covered with thick green moss, tree trunks towering into the clouds, blocking out the sun, and the sun shining through the gaps in the leaves, casting mottled light and shadows. The depths of the forest are hazy and full of mystery, and the overall tone is cold, with blue and green creating a gloomy and quiet atmosphere. 8K ultra-high definition, rich details, the texture of the moss is clearly visible, the texture of the trees is rough, with a film texture and a strong sense of reality. The photographic work has a Gothic style. --s 100 --ar 9:16 --v 7 --profile hp5mhqy --no ai-generated texture
