CN：梦幻森林场景，水彩/数字绘画风格，幽暗的蓝紫色调，月光照亮森林小径，营造出神秘宁静的氛围。画面中心是蜿蜒的小溪，两岸是光秃秃的树枝，点缀着少量橙色和棕色的落叶。两只白色兔子状生物，一只坐在溪边，一只栖息在树枝上，与环境融为一体。构图采用对称式布局，小溪作为画面中心线，两侧树木形成自然的框架。光线主要来自画面深处月光，营造出朦胧梦幻的效果。风格类似于童话插画或概念艺术，细节精细，笔触柔和。整体感觉清新、诗意，具有现代艺术的审美。
EN：A dreamy forest scene in a watercolor/digital painting style, with dark blue-purple tones and moonlight illuminating the forest trail, creating a mysterious and peaceful atmosphere. In the center of the picture is a winding stream, with bare branches on both sides, dotted with a small amount of orange and brown fallen leaves. Two white rabbit-like creatures, one sitting by the stream and the other perched on a branch, blend into the environment. The composition adopts a symmetrical layout, with the stream as the center line of the picture and the trees on both sides forming a natural frame. The light mainly comes from the moonlight deep in the picture, creating a hazy and dreamy effect. The style is similar to fairy tale illustrations or conceptual art, with fine details and soft brushstrokes. The overall feeling is fresh and poetic, with the aesthetic of modern art. --q 1 --s 100 --ar 16:9 --v 6.1 --personalize srak4m6
