CN：彩色铅笔画，写意，潦草，肖像，特写，一位忧郁的亚洲帅哥，黑色凌乱头发，蓝色眼睛，部分脸庞被黑色围巾遮挡，雪花落在头发和围巾上。风格偏向于日式动漫风格，但笔触粗犷，色彩柔和，带有写意绘画的质感，整体色调偏冷。光线柔和，没有明显的强光源，营造出一种朦胧、安静的氛围，
EN：Color pencil drawing, freehand, scribbled, portrait, close-up, a melancholy Asian handsome man, black messy hair, blue eyes, part of his face is covered by a black scarf, snowflakes fall on his hair and scarf. The style is more like Japanese anime style, but the brushstrokes are rough, the colors are soft, with the texture of freehand painting, and the overall tone is cold. The light is soft, there is no obvious strong light source, creating a hazy and quiet atmosphere, --q 5 --s 100 --ar 1:1 --niji 6
