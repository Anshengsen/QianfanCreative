CN：幽谷仙姬，一袭缥缈纱衣，碧绿灵珠点缀其间，黛眉轻蹙，透露着不食人间烟火的脱俗气质。周身自然元素涌动，脚下生莲，步步生辉，背后悬浮着一本泛着淡淡荧光的古籍，似是藏着无上仙诀。背景为浩渺星空与幽邃山川，营造出一种超凡脱俗的玄幻意境，构图灵动，细节精致，展现出女主角的空灵与神秘。
EN：The fairy of the valley, wearing a misty gauze dress, dotted with green spirit beads, with dark eyebrows slightly frowned, reveals a detached temperament that is not in touch with the world. Natural elements are surging around her, lotus flowers are growing under her feet, and every step is shining. Behind her is a faint fluorescent ancient book floating, which seems to contain the supreme fairy secret. The background is the vast starry sky and deep mountains and rivers, creating a kind of otherworldly fantasy artistic conception, with a smart composition and exquisite details, showing the ethereal and mysterious heroine. --q 1 --s 180 --ar 3:4 --niji 6 --personalize vqg1oua
